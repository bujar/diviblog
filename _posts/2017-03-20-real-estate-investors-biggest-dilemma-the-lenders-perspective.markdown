The type of financing a real estate investor obtains will probably make or break their investment. Poor leverage decisions can tangle an investor in even more debt and turn a positive investment experience sour. One of the biggest problems that many investors have – either starting out or experienced – is not properly understanding a lender’s perspective, which in turn reduces the chances of getting a loan.

Here are the things a lender will be typically care about, and more importantly, what any real estate investor should consider before reaching out to a lender for financing. Which one do you think is the most important?

<ol>
	<li><b>1.  Liquidity (Debt-to-Income)</b></li>
	<li><b>2.  Sufficient Funds / Reserves</b></li>
	<li><b>3.  Credit Score</b></li>
	<li><b>4.  Employment History</b></li>
	<li><b>5.  Collateral</b></li>
</ol>



Liquidity, collateral, employment, and credit score are very important from a lender’s perspective. A lender wants to have a full grasp of their borrower’s capability to pay interest and principal on the loan, and they also want to make sure the underlying collateral (the real estate) can recover their losses. Thus, lenders do extensive analysis and verification of the borrower’s monthly income and debt repayment behaviors. In order to ensure they are covered from the worst-case scenario – i.e. a borrower walking away and leaving the property behind – the lender will need to be able to sell the asset and get their money back, hence real estate investors are almost always required to put a down payment.

What most investors don’t realize is how much weight lenders typically put on a borrower’s reserves. <i><b>Not only are real estate investors typically required to save approximately 6 months of future debt service on top of their down payment, they might also need to save enough for reserves on every mortgage that they might have.</b></i> For real estate investors out there looking to get multiple mortgages to build your portfolio, consider this point closely and work with your lender to see how much reserves you need!

Real estate investors who can fully understand these points should have no trouble paving a path to financial freedom.
