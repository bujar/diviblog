DiviSmart has fielded many questions on where to get started as a real estate investor, and we noticed many beginning investors decide to take on large metropolitan areas due to higher rents. With rising housing prices across the country, is that really the smartest strategy for the amateur real estate investor?

NYC is undoubtedly one of the largest cities in the world, so purchasing a real estate investment there seems like a logical answer. A single-bedroom apartment can fetch anywhere between $1,500 - $4,500 in Brooklyn; not including the more prime locations in Manhattan and the waterfront areas of the other boroughs. Anywhere else in the world, $1,500 monthly rental is a pretty good motivation to try your real estate investment strategy, but here are the reasons why NYC (and likely most metropolitan areas) is harder to succeed for cash flow investors:

The NYC housing market has been very hot for the last decade.  With a rising population and international investors seeking opportunities, the demand for housing has never been higher and so have home values. The disadvantage to higher housing prices is the amount of initial capital needed for a real estate investment. A 20% down payment on a condo in Brooklyn is probably much higher than one for 3-bedroom single-family house in Columbus, Ohio. Yet, both places can probably fetch $1,500 per month in rent, but the initial cost of investment is much higher in NYC.

<p style="font-size:150%;">Rent stabilized apartments and rental regulations.</p>

Probably one of the strangest aspects of NYC is rent stabilization. Typically, many multi-family properties in Brooklyn and Queens are rent stabilized, meaning if the building qualifies, the landlord can only increase rent by a small percentage.  The downside of the law is that even if the tenant is a nightmare, owners are still required to renew their lease annually, as long as the property qualifies as rent stabilized. Given this huge advantage, many renters would rather die than leave!

<p style="font-size:150%;">High servicing costs.</p>

Being in a large metropolitan area, the prices for various services are higher than suburbs and smaller towns. Finding and hiring a plumber would likely cost multiples of smaller areas, and this will directly impact your bottom line as a real estate investor.

Despite these disadvantages, buying large city real estate also a great advantage of retaining value. Due to persistently high demand, there is likely a floor even during economic downturns. Moreover, unlike small towns where a single-large employer leaving can disrupt the rental market; large cities like NYC require more serious macro effects to impact the investor.
