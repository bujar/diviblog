To the amateur investor, breaking into real estate investing may seem like an incredibly daunting challenge. In reality, real estate investing is probably one of the safest and most reliable forms of growing your money, and also an easy investing medium that anyone can easily pick up. Unlike equities, the real estate market is resilient and less volatile; and an investor doesn't need to crunch exotic numbers or - at least to a certain extent - take into account geopolitical or macroeconomic factors in their pre-investment analysis. True, there might be housing crisis concerns and interest rate risks, but at the end of the day, a real estate asset preserves incredible value if it can simply provide someone a home.

Breaking into real estate investing is understandably intimidating; one must consider the location of the property, market price, future price stability, rental ability, taxes, remodeling and maintenance expenses, background of a tenant, or even eviction strategies - only to name a few. But the core of real estate investing is no different than any sort of equity or bond investment, which still relies on one of two underlying fundamental strategies: the dividend strategy and value appreciation strategy.

The first step for a beginning real estate investor is to understand exactly what type of strategy they need to pursue in order to reach their investment goals.

<b>Dividend Strategy (Free Cash Flow)</b>

Like buying a stock in a successful public company, able to achieve rich quarterly/annual dividends and putting your money to work, a dividend strategy is really no different in real estate. In fact, real estate may provide more stable and constant cash streams than some investments altogether. The only difference perhaps is the ongoing management of a home, versus buying equity or bonds which do not require servicing or property management.

A dividend strategy for real estate is more demanding versus other asset classes and really requires careful valuation and opportunity assessment. Investors must consider the leverage costs and options, home price (over or undervalued), rental rates, taxes, insurance, and numerous other factors that will reduce your in-pocket cash flow.

Positive cash flow streams will help investors provide additional income, either for that getaway vacation each year to the Bahamas, or to expedite saving up for that brand new Tesla. Or if you are really ambitious, rolling/saving the income on your property to buy more and more real estate, may even help you sustain enough passive income that equates to a full-time job's salary. You can even retire earlier!

<b>Value Appreciation Strategy</b>

Value appreciation strategy actually takes many forms. Investors can purchase a real estate asset to rehab and flip, live in the property for several years first (owner-occupied) then sell, or even rent it out with little to no excess cash flow and sell at higher prices when the home value goes up. Value appreciation strategies rely heavily on the market itself to bring the average sale/purchase price up to a profitable level. This results in a lot of external, uncontrollable, and systematic risks for investors. Take for example, Brooklyn, NY; housing prices have appreciated at record rates and the rising demand caused by a growing population, has maintained this level of value appreciation for years. On the other hand, in less populated cities and suburbs, the market pricing is incredibly hard to predict since the local population may fluctuate - what happens if the local large manufacturer goes bankrupt or a hurricane comes through? This may even cause value depreciation at times!

Versus a stable dividend strategy, investors are effectively making a bet on the market - like making a play on the future value of a home. Typically, in many metropolitan cities especially - say, SF and NYC - the rent is still not enough to cover the underlying expenses of a home, so investors have no choice but pray the future value goes up. This happens because (1) property prices are too high as more buyers compete and cash floods the housing market, and (2) the rental market is oversupplied which drives rents lower from competition.

<b>The BEST Strategy</b>

The needle in a haystack, or the cream of the crop, and ideal target for any investor is to find a property that can sustain positive cash flow AND sell for a profit in later years. That is a win-win and the best strategy of all, but requires extensive foresight and work to identify.

Of course, real estate investing is never that simple, there are also numerous other niche opportunities out there; not to mention the small intricacies that an investor must learn and master in order to maximize every opportunity. Still, the first and most important of any real estate investment is to understand and identify exactly what one's own investment requirements are. Doing so will make the next step (sourcing actual opportunities) infinitely easier and more clear.
