<b>DiviSmart is a company created to provide unique and value-added real estate analytics to the public domain at no cost.</b>

We feel that the online real estate investment space is dominated by folks who want to take advantage of naive and unbeknownst amateurs and dreamers; pitching pricey investment seminars and strategies, or selling spreadsheet models, which ultimately doesn't benefit the consumer - or make them a better investor. What DiviSmart aims to do, is promote more transparency in this space. We believe institutionalized investing strategies and sophisticated modeling should come at zero cost to individuals who want to learn or improve their decision-making. With the DiviSmart platform, our goal is for users to no longer require a financial analytics background or spreadsheet skills in order to succeed as a real estate investor or professional.

We will not give users the formula to success, but we vow to provide value and aid their investment decisions.

DiviSmart hopes to mimic a rating agency approach to all real estate investments. Similar to Standard & Poor's, Kroll, or Fitch of the bond world, DiviSmart's algorithms promotes an unbiased approach to forecasting a real estate asset's investment potential over different investment horizons. We also provide scenario analysis based on an investor's own expectations versus what market data has shown the property can achieve. Moreover, we perform stress testing on the property simultaneously, in order to simulate recessionary scenarios, and allow investors to understand the potential downside outcomes of their investments.

Our goal for the remainder of the year is to provide users with as much valuable tools as possible. We will be launching additional products through the DiviSmart platform that will service both investors and real estate professionals. Stay tuned.

<i>As of February 2016, the DiviSmart team has officially finalized the restructuring of our business model. We feel that our current platform fully endorses our company's mission and philosophy. DiviSmart was founded on the basis of providing valuable and FREE information to the average person.</i>
