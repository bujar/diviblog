<b>DiviSmart is a startup created to provide unique and value-added real estate analytics to investors, agents, lenders, or any other real estate professional and limited to no cost.</b>

We feel that the online real estate investment space is dominated by individuals who want to take advantage of naive and unbeknownst amateurs and dreamers; pitching pricey investment seminars and strategies, or selling spreadsheet models, which ultimately doesn't benefit the consumer - or make them a better investor, lender, or agent. What DiviSmart aims to do, is promote more transparency in this space. We believe institutionalized investing strategies and sophisticated modeling should come at limited cost to those who want to learn or improve their real estate decision-making. With the DiviSmart platform, our goal is for users to no longer require a financial analytics or quantitative background - or "spreadsheet skills" - in order to succeed as a real estate investor or professional.

We will not give users the formula to success, but we vow to provide value and aid their investment decisions.

DiviSmart hopes to mimic a rating agency approach to all real estate investments. Similar to Standard & Poor's, Kroll, or Fitch of the Wall Street world, DiviSmart's algorithms promotes an unbiased approach to forecasting a real estate asset's investment potential over different investment horizons. We also provide scenario analysis based on the user's own expectations versus what historical market suggests. Moreover, we perform stress testing on the property, in order to simulate recessionary scenarios - i.e. 2008 housing crisis - and allow users to understand the potential downside outcomes of the real estate asset. In knowing all this, investors, lenders, and agents can be more prepared to understand the upside and downside scenarios of any property.

Our goal for the remainder of the year is to provide users with as much valuable tools as possible. We will be launching additional products through the DiviSmart platform that will service both investors and real estate professionals. Stay tuned.
